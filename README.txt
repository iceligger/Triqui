Triqui is a game to play using GIT commands.

The main idea of this game is type 'X' or 'O' in the different cell in the table.The first player select which one to start to play and each turn for that player is mandadory to use the same symbol.

The first player to get 3 same symbols in a row, column or diagonal, will win the game.

Good luck!!!
