Triqui is a game to play using GIT commands.

The main idea of this game is to type 'X' or 'O' in the different cells in the table. The first player selects which one to start to play and each turn for that player is mandatory to use the same symbol.

The first player to get 3 same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, will win the game.

Good luck!!!
